# Hi, I'm Raoof Naushad! 👋

I'm the **CTO & Co-founder** of [Lokam.ai](https://lokam.ai) – an AI startup building voice-first automation for small and medium businesses across industries like automotive, healthcare, and retail. Our flagship product uses **Conversational & Voice AI** to drive real-time customer feedback, enable actionable insights, and boost operational efficiency.

I’m also a **former Data & AI Architect** at RBC, where I helped shape enterprise-scale AI strategy. 

I believe in the transformative power of **education + AI + execution**, and I’m passionate about using technology to create tangible impact for businesses and communities.
